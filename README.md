Many good things in life come about through happenstance. Icebreaker enables happenstance for your team. Icebreaker is a Teams bot that helps the whole team get closer by pairing up members every week at random to meet for coffee, burgers, pizza, or a walk around the block. The bot does the heavy lifting of finding a new person to meet with each week, and aids in scheduling the meetup.

Icebreaker works really well for cultivating small, interest-based communities within your organization. For example, an organization may leverage this bot for a DevOps interest group to help facilitate organic cross-pollination of ideas and best practices. Another common use case is new employees’ cohorts to help employees learn more about each other and assimilate better in the new environment.
